# Pomoclock

A deterministic Pomodoro timer that syncs with clock time. Every half hour is split into a 25-minute work period followed by a 5-minute break.

The timer automatically aligns with real clock time, so everyone using the app is synchronized to the same work/break schedule.

## Usage

Simply open index.html in a browser. The timer will show the remaining time in the current period.
