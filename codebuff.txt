create a vanilla HTML project in /pomoclock with index.html, scripts.js, and styles.css that shows a timer that maps to clock time meaning from the top of the hour to 25 past it counts down from 25 mins and at 25 past it counts down from 5 mins and repeats for the next half hour so any time the page is loaded the countdown is happening and it appears in 3rem size, craft a brief README.md file that describes the project, keep the code as minimal as possible
